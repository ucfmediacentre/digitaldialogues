=======
SwarmTV is an interactive website that augments the thinking process. It uses a drag and drop interface and is designed so that anyone can post any text, images, audio or movie files, and then drag them into any position on the page so that they create connections with other material on the page. Anyone can edit, and anyone can push the media into new lines of thinking.
