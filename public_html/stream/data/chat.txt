<span>tash</span>lol 
<span>Victoria Opyrchal</span>lol :P 
<span>tash</span>*clap clap* 
<span>wk155668</span>apluase 
<span>tash</span>i didnt understand half of it but it was interesting 
<span>TM155185</span>Cool. 
<span>wk155668</span>interesting but confusin yes 
<span>Victoria Opyrchal</span>that was cool 
<span>wk155668</span>i got some of it  
<span>wk155668</span>i got the bit about being part of the camera and stuff 
<span>TM155185</span>I've seen round photographs. 
<span>Victoria Opyrchal</span>lol 
<span>Alcwyn</span>on round paper? 
<span>Victoria Opyrchal</span>hehe 
<span>wk155668</span>lmao 
<span>Victoria Opyrchal</span>lol 
<span>wk155668</span>yea but u dnt take round photos on the camera do u  
<span>Victoria Opyrchal</span>XD 
<span>wk155668</span>there rectangle 
<span>Victoria Opyrchal</span>lmao 
<span>Guest</span>you can with a fish eye lense i believe  
<span>Guest</span>its more round :S  
<span>Alcwyn</span>the iris is round 
<span>Victoria Opyrchal</span>:P 
<span>Alcwyn</span>and yet we insist on rectangle negative 
<span>Victoria Opyrchal</span>lol 
<span>wk155668</span>ahhh fair point 
<span>TM155185</span>I'd argue that the use of the rectangle is a matter of logic 
<span>TM155185</span>it's the same reason that it's used on screens 
<span>Alcwyn</span>where is the creativity in that 
<span>Alcwyn</span>there is a large amount of cropping  
<span>Victoria Opyrchal</span>exactly, paper waste, etc 
<span>Victoria Opyrchal</span>not worth the trouble eh? 
<span>Alcwyn</span>its a nice concept though 
<span>Victoria Opyrchal</span>no really for the business though 
<span>Victoria Opyrchal</span>not* 
<span>Alcwyn</span>this is important *** 
<span>Victoria Opyrchal</span>wait, with the concept? cause I was meant to say &quot;not really for the business though&quot; because... 
<span>Alcwyn</span>no what he just said 
<span>Victoria Opyrchal</span>the cropping is wasting resources 
<span>Victoria Opyrchal</span>oh, ok 
<span>TM155185</span>You use 2 dimensions - equilateral quadratics because that's the most area to the least space .
<span>Alcwyn</span>back to the capitalist ideal 
<span>Alcwyn</span>;) 
<span>Victoria Opyrchal</span>:D 
<span>tash</span>clap clap clap 
<span>TM155185</span>#applause
