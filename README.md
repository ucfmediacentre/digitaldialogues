===========

Swarm TV is live at <a href="ucfmediacentre.co.uk/swarmtv/">www.swarmtv.org</a>

It is a website developed for collaborative thinking - particularly in the area of filmmaking. Like Wikipedia, anyone can edit their own text; upload images, audio files or videos and create new pages. Everything is designed around a drag and drop interface and it is very handy for sorting out ideas.
